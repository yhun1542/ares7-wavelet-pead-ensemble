You are a quantitative strategy optimization expert. We previously implemented MDD improvement techniques (Volatility Targeting + Drawdown-Based Regime Switch) that successfully reduced MDD from -23.62% to -9.67%, but the annualized return dropped from 58.59% to 45.55%. This is unacceptable.

## Current Situation

**Before MDD Improvement:**
- Sharpe Ratio: 2.83
- Annualized Return: 58.59%
- Annualized Volatility: 20.72%
- MDD: -23.62%
- CVaR (95%): 0.0227

**After MDD Improvement (Current Problem):**
- Sharpe Ratio: 3.26 (✓ Improved)
- Annualized Return: 45.55% (✗ Too much reduction)
- Annualized Volatility: 13.98% (✓ Reduced)
- MDD: -9.67% (✓ Target achieved)
- CVaR (95%): 0.0159 (✓ Improved)

## Problem

The annualized return dropped by 13.04% (from 58.59% to 45.55%), which is too much. We need to maintain or improve the annualized return while keeping MDD below -10%.

## Requirements

1. **Maintain or improve annualized return** (target: 58%+)
2. **Keep MDD below -10%** (already achieved at -9.67%)
3. **Maintain or improve Sharpe Ratio** (currently 3.26)
4. **Keep CVaR low** (currently 0.0159)

## Question

How can we modify the MDD improvement approach to recover the lost returns while maintaining the MDD improvement? Please provide:

1. **Root cause analysis**: Why did returns drop so much?
2. **Proposed solution**: Specific techniques to recover returns
3. **Python code**: Complete, immediately usable implementation
4. **Expected impact**: Quantitative estimates of the improvement

## Possible Approaches (or propose better ones)

- Asymmetric position sizing (reduce only on downside, not upside)
- Trend-following overlay to capture upside momentum
- Dynamic leverage adjustment (increase exposure during favorable conditions)
- Selective drawdown protection (protect only during severe market stress)
- Return stacking or portable alpha techniques
- Other innovative methods

Please provide **concrete Python code** that can be integrated into our existing framework.
