You are a world-class quantitative finance expert specializing in risk management and portfolio optimization.

CONTEXT:
We have successfully implemented an Adaptive Asymmetric Risk Management (AARM) strategy for ARES7 ensemble trading system with the following current performance (after fixing look-ahead bias and including transaction costs):

- Sharpe Ratio: 3.38
- Annualized Return: 73.16%
- Maximum Drawdown (MDD): -16.22%
- Annualized Volatility: 21.65%
- CVaR (95%): -0.0248

PROBLEM:
While the strategy significantly outperforms the baseline (Sharpe 2.83, Return 58.67%, MDD -23.62%), we still need to:
1. Reduce MDD from -16.22% to -10% or below (PRIMARY GOAL)
2. Maintain or increase Sharpe Ratio above 3.38 (SECONDARY GOAL)
3. Maintain or increase annualized return above 73%

CURRENT AARM COMPONENTS:
- Asymmetric volatility targeting (downside vs upside)
- Kelly Criterion dynamic leverage (up to 2.0x)
- Momentum overlay (±30% based on trend)
- Graduated drawdown response (progressive position reduction)
- Regime detection (volatility-based)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must avoid look-ahead bias
- Must include realistic transaction costs (0.1%)
- Must pass OOS (out-of-sample) validation
- Average turnover should remain reasonable (<5%)

QUESTION:
What specific techniques or modifications can we implement to achieve MDD ≤ -10% while maintaining or improving Sharpe ≥ 3.38?

Please provide:
1. Root cause analysis: Why is MDD still at -16.22% despite AARM?
2. Specific actionable techniques (2-3 techniques maximum)
3. Complete Python implementation code that can be directly integrated into our existing AARM framework
4. Expected performance improvement estimates

Focus on practical, proven techniques that balance risk reduction with return preservation.
